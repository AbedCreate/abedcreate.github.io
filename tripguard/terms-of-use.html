    <h1>Terms of Use for TripGuard</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: September 23, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
        Welcome to TripGuard. By downloading, accessing, or using the TripGuard mobile application (the “App”), you agree to these
        Terms of Use (“Terms”). These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and TripGuard Intel & Transit Ltd.
        Please read them carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        TripGuard exists for one core purpose: to make roads and transportation safer for everyone through community-driven safety
        reporting. Every feature, policy, and guideline in this document is built around that purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old to register as a driver.</li>
        <li>Riders under 18 must use the App under parental or guardian supervision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for securing your login credentials.</li>
        <li>You must provide accurate, truthful, and up-to-date information.</li>
        <li>
            TripGuard Intel & Transit Ltd. may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or present safety or security risks.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>

    </ul>

    <p>
        By using TripGuard, you agree to use all safety, caution, and reporting tools responsibly, truthfully, and in good faith in
        support of our shared mission of safer roads.
    </p>
